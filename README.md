# Juno <> OpenAI

This demo showcases a straightforward integration of OpenAI's technologies, including DALL·E and the GPT-4 Vision Preview, into a decentralized application (dApp) using [Juno](https://juno.build)'s platform. It utilizes smart contracts to query OpenAI's models, leveraging the efficiency and scalability of Juno's serverless functions. This example illustrates how Juno's infrastructure can be used to incorporate AI capabilities into blockchain applications, providing a practical approach to accessing advanced AI features through smart contract operations.
